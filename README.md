WIT is a wireless transfer that enables you to share your files, apps, contacts, photos, audio files with anyone in the same subnet.<br/>
You can even share thing without a gateway device if you turn on the Hotspot mode.<br/>
This tool provides a very fascinating user interface and is very easy to use.<br/>

- WIT for Android<br/>
  It includes a two-level encryption. The transmitted files will be encrypted by AES keys. The keys will be encrypted by RSA public keys.<br/>
  We also provide a function to verify the files by MD5 checksum.<br/>
  This app contains lists for all apps, contacts, photos, music and files in your phone. You can also record every user who was connected to you and import it to a new contact.<br/>
  <br/>
- WIT for iOS<br/>
  We encapsulated the raw BSD sockets and modified the problematic code of AsyncSocket to support network communication on iPhones.<br/>
  The protocol of WIT for iOS is simplified so it cannot connect to WIT for Android directly.
